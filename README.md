# Todo-App
This Todo-App was created for an example on how to connect a python backend to a react native frontend.<br>
I have included a post function that allows for the user to create a todo, a get function to get all the todos, and a delete function to remove the todos.<br>
There is also a pull down refresh using RefreshControl to update the app without restarting.
